# Mobile Developer Coding Challenge

This is a coding challenge for prospective mobile developer applicants applying through http://work.traderev.com/

## Compile:
API Version 27. Install if asked.

Install kotlin plugin if not present.
> The Kotlin plugin is bundled with Android Studio starting from version 3.0. If you use an earlier version, you'll need to install the Kotlin plugin. Go to File | Settings | Plugins | Install JetBrains plugin… and then search for and install Kotlin. If you are looking at the "Welcome to Android Studio" screen, choose Configure | Plugins | Install JetBrains plugin… You'll need to restart the IDE after this completes.

## Goal:

#### Build simple app that allows viewing and interacting with a grid of curated photos from Unsplash

- [x] Fork this repo. Keep it public until we have been able to review it.
- [x] Android: _Java_ or _Kotlin_ | iOS: _Swift 3_
- [x] Unsplash API docs are here: https://unsplash.com/documentation.
- [x] Grid of photos should preserve the aspect ratio of the photos it's displaying, meaning you shouldn't crop the image in any way.
- [x] Grid should work in both portrait and landscape orientations of the device.
- [x] Grid should support pagination, i.e. you can scroll on grid of photos infinitely.
- [x] When user taps on a photo on the grid it should show the photo in full screen with more information about the photo.
- [x] When user swipes on a photo in full screen, it should show the the next photo and preserve current photos location on the grid, so when she dismisses the full screen, grid of photos should contain the last photo she saw.

### Evaluation:
- [x] Solution compiles. If there are necessary steps required to get it to compile, those should be covered in README.md.
- [x] No crashes, bugs, compiler warnings
- [x] App operates as intended
- [x] Conforms to SOLID principles
- [x] Code is easily understood and communicative
- [x] Commit history is consistent, easy to follow and understand
